I have created 2 projects with all necesery elements in html page (by the book),
    using json from exchangerate-api.com
    1. in PHP
        - widget.php
            To simplify the web page all styles are embeded into the same page
            
    2. JavaScript and HTML
        - widget.html
        - widget.css
        - widget.js

widget is located on the top right corner of the page in fixed position.     
The page will refresh  every 10 min or by clicking the refresh buton.
